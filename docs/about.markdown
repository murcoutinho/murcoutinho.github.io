# Summary

I have a Bachelor's and Master's degree in data science, as well as a Ph.D. in cryptography. I am the author of some of the best cryptanalysis against the stream ciphers [Salsa and ChaCha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20) developed by [D.J.Bernstein](https://cr.yp.to/snuffle.html#security). I am also the designer of [Forró](https://github.com/murcoutinho/forro_cipher), a very fast and secure stream cipher. Over the past decade, I have been working as a cryptographer and software engineer for Brazilian institutions. For example, contributed to the Supreme Electoral Court of Brazil ([TSE](https://www.tse.jus.br/eleicoes/eleicoes-2022/eleicoes-2022)) deploying cryptography that was used by all citizens of the country during election day. Currently, I am working as a cryptographer for [Nubank](https://nubank.com.br/en/), the largest fintech bank in Latin America.

# Some open-source projects
- [forro_cipher](https://github.com/murcoutinho/forro_cipher): This repository contains the implementation for the Forró cipher, a fast stream cipher proposed at Asiacrypt 2022.
- [cryptanalysisChaCha](https://github.com/murcoutinho/cryptanalysisChaCha): the code for the paper "Improved Linear Approximations to ARX Ciphers and Attacks Against ChaCha" published in Eurocrypt 2021.
- [cryptDances](https://github.com/murcoutinho/cryptDances): Tool to perform cryptanalysis of ChaCha, Salsa and Forró in high performance environments (using OpenMPI and CUDA).
- [LLL](https://github.com/murcoutinho/LLL): implementation of the [Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra%E2%80%93Lenstra%E2%80%93Lov%C3%A1sz_lattice_basis_reduction_algorithm) in Rust.
- [particle-simulator](https://github.com/murcoutinho/particle-simulator): just a fun project. Consists of a beautiful simulation of the interaction between particles. Here all particles have the same mass and the inflicted force among each other can be controlled by the user.
